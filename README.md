06/11/2025 1:56AM - Learned how to Setup a Next JS environment using Node JS, Revisited a lot of React concepts and new next js routing variants, the most challenging part was setting everything up! While getting the first website going wasn't as difficult there were some trouble to begin with but by the end of the day with around 6 hours of work we got a good modern next js application's first page and im looking forward to implementing a shop logic tomorrow or in a few days. Utilized quite a bit of xAI to make the code writing process fast paced and everything came out very smoothly.

06/11/2025 8:37PM - Complete implemention of shop logic with a lot of ai help. Im still new to these stuff on typescript but im quite proud that i got some logic done myself. Hopefully within the future will be able to understand all fo it xD. Will revisit this project a lot to check how to implement systems similar to this it's actually pretty amazining.
